        <h1>Research</h1>
        <p>The research at GRAPPA lies at the intersection of astrophysics, theoretical physics, particle/high-energy physics, and cosmology. We focus on four core research directions.</p>

        <h2 id="#multimessenger">Multimessenger astrophysics</h2>

        <p>Since the dawn of humanity the cosmos has been studied using visible light; first with the naked eye, and since the early 17th century increasingly with optical telescopes. Telescopes then played a key role in establishing the heliocentric worldview, and allowed a first glimpse at the magnificence and richness of objects in the Universe. In the late 19th century, Maxwell's equations predicted that there is even more than what meets the eye. Driven by a myriad of technological innovations, the 20th century saw the opening of the entire electromagnetic spectrum to study the Universe, from radio waves to gamma-rays. This enabled us to study in great detail many aspects of the Universe, including the early hot phase just after the Big Bang, the formation of galaxies and stars, and extreme objects like neutron stars and black holes.</p>

        <p>Nowadays, yet another phase in studying the Universe has arrived, with the addition of all kinds of other non-light signals: Highly energetic particles (cosmic rays, discovered in 1912), and the very hard to detect neutrinos (first detection of solar neutrinos in 1968) and gravitational waves. Gravitational waves are the latest addition to these cosmic harbingers, predicted by Einstein already in 1916, and first detected only in 2015. All these different signals provide us with highly specific knowledge about the physical processes that take place in the Universe. The study of objects like black holes, of neutron stars and star forming regions, or explosive/transient events in the Universe, using the full range of these signals, is referred to as “multi-messenger astrophysics”.</p>

        <p>Many of these messengers may act at the same time. For example: if two neutron stars spiralling around each other finally merge into a new object, probably a black hole, the in-spiralling leads to the release of gravitational waves, which can be detected. The merging of the two neutron stars itself leads to a powerful nuclear explosion producing much light, but the final compact object also launches jets that give rise to the acceleration of particles such as protons and electrons to very high energies. The energetic electrons will radiate across the entire electromagnetic spectrum, whereas the protons could contribute to the cosmic rays detected on Earth, or they may collide in the neighbourhood of the explosion with other protons and produce highly energetic neutrinos and gamma-rays.</p>

        <p>Members of GRAPPA play a world-wide leading role in many aspects of multi-messenger astrophysics. The group of Christoph Weniger studies the generation and propagation of cosmic rays in the Milky Way using gamma-ray data.</p>

        <h2>Dark Universe</h2>

        <p>One of the most important discoveries of the past 50 years in physics and astronomy, is that there is much more to the universe that meets the eye: the universe appears to be permeated by mysterious forms of matter and energy, that shape the universe and determine its structure and evolution.</p>

        <p>According to modern cosmology, only 5% of the matter and energy budget of the universe is made of the same form of matter that we see all around us -- which as we know is made of atoms. The remaining 95% is referred to as the ‘dark universe’.</p>

        <p>We don’t know much about this dark side of of the universe, but if we look at the matter-energy budget of the universe today, we can confidently say that on very large scales 25% appears to be composed of an unknown form of matter, known as dark matter, and another 70% behaves like a sort of repulsive gravity, that pushes the universe to expand ever faster, and is generically referred to as dark energy.</p>

        <p>These are not mere conjectures: the Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded in 2011 to Saul Perlmutter, Brian Schmidt and Adam Riess, for the discovery of the accelerated expansion of the universe, and in 2019 (for one half) to Jim Peebles, for theoretical discoveries in cosmology, including his pioneering work on dark matter.</p>

        <p>The existence of dark matter has long been suspected, and at GRAPPA we actually study the fascinating history of this elusive component of the universe (Bertone, van Dongen). But it was only in the 1970s that different lines of evidence merged within the framework of the rising field of physical cosmology, and provided convincing evidence for a form of matter that is fundamentally different from anything we have ever observed in our laboratories, or with our powerful telescopes.</p>

        <p>Researchers at GRAPPA try to identify the nature of dark matter with a variety of approaches: we devise strategies to detect high-energy radiation produced by dark matter (Ando, Bertone, Weniger), we set up methods for detecting dark matter ‘clumps’ with gravitational lenses and stellar streams (Ando, Bertone, Weniger), and we explore the new opportunities arising from the booming field of gravitational waves (Baumann, Bertone, Weniger).</p>

        <p>Our group is also active in the field of dark energy, with GRAPPA researchers pioneering a new method to determine the expansion rate of the universe, based again on gravitational waves (Nissanke).</p>

        <h2>The Early Universe</h2>

        <p>The early universe was hot and dense. Interactions between particles were very frequent and energetic. Matter was in the form of free electrons and atomic nuclei with light bouncing between them. As the primordial plasma cooled, the light elements (hydrogen, helium and lithium) formed. About 380 000 years after the Big Bang, the temperature had dropped enough for the first stable atoms to exist. At that moment, photons started to propagate freely through the universe. Today, billions of years later, we observe this afterglow of the Big Bang as a faint microwave radiation. This relic radiation isn’t completely uniform but varies in its intensity across the sky (see Fig. 1). These fluctuations reflect tiny variations in the density of the primordial matter, which over time, and under the influence of gravity, grew. Dense regions were getting denser. Eventually, galaxies, stars and planets formed and the large-scale structure of the universe was created.</p>

        <p>But, what created the fluctuations in the cosmic microwave background? What was the fundamental origin of the large-scale structure of the universe? A remarkable fact about our Universe is that the structures we see around us are not distributed randomly but rather display interesting spatial correlations. A central challenge of modern cosmology is to construct a consistent history of the Universe that explains these correlations. Observations suggest that the primordial correlations were created before the hot Big Bang, at energies far exceeding those probed by particle colliders. Members of GRAPPA are playing a leading role in the quest to understand the Universe under these extreme conditions.</p>

        <p>One of the leading proposals for the origin of structure in the Universe is “cosmological inflation.” According to this theory, the Universe experienced a burst of very rapid expansion just fractions of a second after the Big Bang. Microscopic quantum fluctuations got stretched to cosmic scales providing the seeds for the large-scale structure of the Universe. The correlations observed in the afterglow of the Big Bang were inherited from correlations in the quantum-mechanical fluctuations during inflation (see Fig. 2). While inflation is a very successful phenomenological model, it is not yet a complete theory. In particular, the physical origin of the inflationary expansion is still a mystery. Members of GRAPPA are investigating the physics of inflation in theories of quantum gravity and from the viewpoint of effective field theory (Baumann, Freivogel). They are also exploring the phenomenological consequences of inflation, including the possibility that inflation gave rise to primordial black holes (Bertone).</p>

        <h2>Gravitational waves/strong gravity</h2>

        <p>Gravitational waves are ripples in spacetime curvature caused by some of the most violent and energetic events in the Universe. They are an intrinsic prediction of General Relativity, that were first proposed by Albert Einstein in 1916. They are generated by massive asymmetric accelerating masses, such as inspiralling and merging pairs of neutron stars, black holes and white dwarfs (aka. compact objects), and travel at the speed of light, carrying critical information about extreme spacetime, extreme gravity objects and extreme events (such as the Big Bang and Inflation) in the cosmos.</p>

        <p>After decades of immense experimental and theoretical work, gravitational wave astrophysics became also observationally-driven field with the discovery of gravitational waves from the first pair of black holes merging as observed by the LIGO detectors. Since 2017, the LIGO detectors have continued to improve in sensitivity and have since been joined by the Virgo detector, located in Pisa, Italy (with NL contributions), as well as KAGRA in Japan. Therefore, we now have a worldwide network of ground-based gravitational wave detectors observing tens of compact of mergers, of different flavours (neutron star-neutron star, neutron star-black hole and black hole-black hole mergers) every year, and uncovering a diversity in the fundamental properties of extreme gravity objects. Such a plethora of new observations have allowed us to ask and now answer many new questions including: how and where do compact object mergers form? How do compact objects form and drive the evolution of the Universe? What is the intrinsic nature of black holes, neutron stars and white dwarfs? In addition, a subset of gravitational wave mergers, notably in systems where there is at least one neutron star, are accompanied by electromagnetic counterparts, for instance radioactively powered kilonova or short gamma ray bursts; such events exemplify multi-messenger astronomy.</p>

        <p>At GRAPPA, we are working on many different aspects of gravitational wave astrophysics and physics: gravitational wave and electromagnetic counterpart source modelling (Nissanke and Moesta), gravitational wave parameter inference and machine learning (Nissanke, Weniger), numerical relativity (Moesta), binary and triple stellar evolution (Toonen), primordial black holes and dark matter (Baumann, Bertone and Weniger), gravitational wave cosmology (Nissanke, Baumann) and multi-messenger astrophysics and interpretation (Nissanke, Moesta). Members are active in the Virgo Collaboration and LISA consortium, EU Cost Actions GWVerse, as well as a slew of electromagnetic follow up groups.</p>
